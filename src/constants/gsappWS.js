Jamaica bay is a site of all such uses. This project explores how the unintended byproducts of each municipal process serve as outputs that demand a cyclical process of reconstruction of the ‘natural environment’ in which nature will continue to be redefined by the urban systems that are enabling their re-production.",

Most families bring little else other than their ger— a small, transportable, and collapsable home­. This project proposes two simple additions to the ger-kit which enables residents to build larger spaces to enable businesses and community spaces at little extra cost.",
